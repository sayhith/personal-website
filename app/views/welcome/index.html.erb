Hi! My name is Adria. I’m a self-taught programmer and a University of British Columbia 
graduate with a background in biological sciences. I am currently looking for new opportunities, 
so please reach out if you would like to know more! You can also keep reading for a slightly 
longer spiel about myself.               
<span id='paragraph-break'>____</span>             
I’ve always loved making things from scratch with my own hands (or fingers!) and I love learning 
new things and facing challenges head on. When I was at UBC I took an introductory computer 
science course which I really enjoyed. After that I took a few more courses spanning algorithms 
and data structures to software design, and when I graduated I decided to keep building on that 
knowledge.
            
This self-teaching experience has been challenging at times (looking at you ambiguous Heroku 
errors) but mostly it’s been incredibly exciting. It’s given me the skills to build applications 
such as this website, and a Chinese checkers console app. You can check both of them out under 
my “Project” tab above. 

The best part is that I’ve barely scratched the surface! Some topics I’m interested in and would 
love to learn more about are artificial intelligence, database management and eCommerce to name 
a few. 

Outside of the realm of tech and computer science my hobbies include painting, baking, tennis, 
hiking and attempting to teach myself Korean so I can understand BTS’s lyrics. I also love being 
outdoors, so when the weather’s nice you can find me hiking, trying to improve my tennis game or 
just wandering around snapping pictures of cool looking clouds.
